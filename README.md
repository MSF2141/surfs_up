W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Objectives
- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December

## Softwares
- Python, Pandas in Kupyter Notebook
- SQL Alchemy and SQL Database

## Analysis
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary
