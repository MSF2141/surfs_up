# Weather Data and SQLite Database

## Project Overview
Analyzing a weather data set for the island of Oahu, Hawaii in order to understand whether a surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round. Specifically, with the use of SQLAlchemy, the objective is to connect to the SQLite database and query the temperature data for the months of June and December.

## Objectives
- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December

## Softwares
- Python, Pandas in Jupyter Notebook 6.4.12
- SQLAlchemy and SQLite Database

## Analysis


•	Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database.
•	Use statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze data.


## Results
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
