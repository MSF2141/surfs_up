•	Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database.
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Objectives
- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December

## Softwares
- Python, Pandas in Kupyter Notebook
- SQLAlchemy and SQLite Database

## Analysis
•	Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database.
•	Use statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze data.


## Results
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
